      This would be an auto-generated page with all the answers to the user's
      questions. Below is an example of one argument in defense of the Eucharist using the bible.
    </br>
      Basically, we'd just stitch together the proper response to
      every doubt the user had expressed in the quiz in the logical sequence that progresses towards
      full agreement with the Catholic Church's teachings. So for someone who
      doesn't belive in God, we'd need to go through the evidence for God's
      existence first, then explain why Christianity is the fullness of the
      truth, how it originated, why all the other religions are only partially
      true or completely untrue, and why the Church is correct in each area that
      the other religions are wrong (a full refutation and counterargument). We
      need to not only defend the church's teachings, but also expose the
      falsehoods and fallacies in the doctrines of other belief systems,
      especially protestant faiths. This is different from Catholic Answers
      (catholic.com), Catholics Come Home (catholicscomehome.org), and Word on
      Fire (wordonfire.org) because rather than offering a database for
      searching answers to questions, or collection of inspiring catholic
      homilies, talks, and media, this site will seek to use evidence-based
      reasoning to prove every element of the catholic and convince the user
      that it is worth the effort (read: friction) to go through the process to
      come into the Catholic Church. The main differentiator is that this service takes the answers TO the user, rather than the user having to search and find answers on their own.
